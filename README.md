# Mindless
Mindless is a musical album composed and produced mainly by myself. It's a journey through the cycle of life, through the small acts, the everyday stuff which in reality makes up our reality.
As I continue to develop it I want to record the process as it develops, and someone told me GitHub could be a cool platform do do this on.
In other words, this is a test.
